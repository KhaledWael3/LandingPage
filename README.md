# Landing Page Project

## description
    In this project the main goal is to use JavaScript and the DOM. So the most of the styles were used from the starter code that udacity gave me the access too. A little modification was done to the CSS and HTML to make sure it works properly.  
## techs
    1- Navigation menu was made using JavaScript code and smooth scrolling was added to it.
    2- A 4th section was added to the html file.
    3- Made the section active when scrolling to it using getBoundingClientRect() with a for each loop.
    7- A responsive layout of the landing page was created and made sure to work across all devices.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
